Vercel hosts the sign-in endpoint every authentication request passes through, and so processes connection metadata such as IP address and user agent. Porkbun forwards the support address and Google provides the destination mailbox. Your device opens official USCIS and Department of Justice links in the system browser.

Cleanup runs hourly, so deletion occurs during an hourly cleanup after eligibility rather than at the exact 48-hour instant; a delayed or failed cleanup is retried later. A permanent account is kept until you delete it. Choose Account, Settings, and Delete account to delete the login identity, sessions, saved cases, and other associated Immifile data. An opaque deletion-protection record may remain for up to one hour only to block requests from a stale session; it contains no saved case content, cannot restore the account, and is then removed.',

		title: 'Security and choices',
		body: 'Authentication credentials are transmitted over encrypted connections, and the app stores its session in device secure storage. You may browse official resources without creating a permanent account. Saving a case requires an account so the receipt number is not placed in a short-lived temporary workspace.',

		title: 'Account access in this release',
		body: 'This release has no self-service password reset and does not verify email addresses. Keep your password safe: there is no automated way back into an account without it, and because Immifile cannot confirm ownership of an unverified address, support cannot reset a password or delete an account on request.
